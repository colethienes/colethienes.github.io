## Welcome!

My name is Cole Thienes, and I'm a developer who's been working on his own company, [Koursaros AI](https://koursaros-ai.github.io/). I recently graduated college where I studied Economics and Biology, so my recent experiences in AI/DevOps have been quite a turn of events!

Me and Jack Pertschuk have been open sourcing our recent projects, including [NBoost](https://github.com/koursaros-ai/nboost), a neural search boosting platform.

I'm passionate about open source software, neurobiology, and financial markets. Feel free to reach out!
